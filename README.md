# .emacs.d

This is my Emacs configuration.
It is primarily intended as a configuration backup, but if you find something interesting here, feel free to use it.

## packages

Most extensions are installed as packages with a few exceptions:

- extempore.el is a major mode for [Extempore](https://github.com/digego/extempore)
- slime is loaded via [Quicklisp](quicklisp.org)'s slime-helper.
It is, however, still installed as a dependency for ac-slime.

## cheatsheet

I use a cheatsheet file in order to get used to keybindings (see [here](http://stackoverflow.com/a/271372)).
It can be viewed with `M-x cheatsheet`.
